Hi, I am a junior studying Electrical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. My central interests lie in machine learning, signal processing, semiconductors, and integrated chip design. I am passionately curious in and out of school and enjoy working collaboratively, whether in a research group, on a team, or in a band.

I've been part of WashU's interdisciplinary Beyond Boundaries program, exploring direct applications of engineering to music, and joined Trinity College Dublin's Autonomous Racing Team, working in a team to develop innovative path-planning solutions to pilot a self-driving race car. In internships and coursework, I have tackled complex engineering challenges both in teams and independently. I am eager to bring my skills and passion for problem-solving to new impactful projects.
